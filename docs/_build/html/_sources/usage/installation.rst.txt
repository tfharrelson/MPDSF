Installation
*****

The easiest way to install the code at the present time is to clone the repository, then create a conda/miniconda environment from the requirements.txt. To do this use the command::
        
        conda create -n my_env_name --file requirements.txt

Once this is done creating, you should be able to run the code as long as this environment is active.

Docker
#######

Code is also on Docker hub under the name tharrel4/mpdsf:thin. Usage of this version will not require any conda/miniconda environments, and can be used directly. The exact version of the code on Docker may not be completely up-to-date at all times, however.
